# Discord slash commands handler

A simple handler for Discord's slash commands interactions created with [discord.js@dev](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).


## Installation

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and paste your own token. Then, use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install all the modules.

```bash
yarn
```

In alternative, you can also use npm, but I don't recommend it.
```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

```bash
yarn dev
```
or
```bash
npm run dev
```

## FAQ
**How do I create a command?**

You need to do that by yourself, this is a command handler, so it simply handles incoming commands. You need to create your own commands first.
